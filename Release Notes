Additions:
	- Added second layer of scientific operators (Looks)

Functionality:
	- Can do basic math functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide, modulo)
	- Can handle demcimal arithmetic
	- Can handle negative numbers
	- Can delete last entered value with backspace button
	- Stores entered values in an array of objects holding the value and the operator immediately following it	
	- Can clear stored values to start a new calculation	
	- Stores history
	- Can pull from history and restore a previously used expression
	- Can clear history
